# SMART_UAV_disaster_algorithm_1
Code for a single UAV object in a disaster relief fleet

The current working code, uploaded on 7/11/2018, can be found in the folder Simulation_Code_1.

uavDriver5 runs a single simulation, can be used for quick assessment.


The files Request6.m, UAVDrone6.m, RequestZone6, and Manager6 classes each contain properties and functions of different aspects of the system, UAVSim3.m uses these class files to run a single simulation.

The file "MasterPlan3.m" runs single or multiple simulations, which can either generate excel files from results, or can perform sensitivity analysis of results. Change map and request zone information as indicated to apply the simulation to a desired scenario.
